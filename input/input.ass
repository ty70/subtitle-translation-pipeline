Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.22,0:00:45.46,Default,,0,0,0,,In 1969, Volker Strassen revolutionized the field
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.56,0:00:49.82,Default,,0,0,0,,by discovering an algorithm to multiply two 2x2 matrices
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.16,0:00:54.66,Default,,0,0,0,,using only seven scalar multiplications, down from the standard eight.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.54,0:00:59.40,Default,,0,0,0,,The established best practice for larger matrices, like 4x4s,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.66,0:01:02.94,Default,,0,0,0,,was to apply Strassen's 2x2 method recursively.

Dialogue: 0,0:01:32.74,0:01:35.00,Default,,0,0,0,,AlphaZero was purely self-play,

Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.34,0:01:48.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Google DeepMind recently has been focused on scientific discovery

Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.54,0:02:15.34,Default,,0,0,0,,still nothing better was known than doing Strassen twice

Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.64,0:02:22.56,Default,,0,0,0,,So, we were really excited when we used Alpha Evolve in this setting.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:23.10,0:02:26.30,Default,,0,0,0,,We actually didn't even hope that it would find something better than 49,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.34,0:02:28.90,Default,,0,0,0,,because we were trying for so long with AlphaTensor.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.16,0:02:32.46,Default,,0,0,0,,We just ran it for completeness, because we wanted to have this table
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.50,0:02:35.80,Default,,0,0,0,,in the paper that we actually have, that we tried on all the sizes
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.84,0:02:40.50,Default,,0,0,0,,up to five or six, and remarkably, it found a faster algorithm,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.54,0:02:43.40,Default,,0,0,0,,which uses 48 instead of 49 multiplications.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.20,0:02:46.84,Default,,0,0,0,,It's a bit like cursor on steroids.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.16,0:02:51.74,Default,,0,0,0,,It iteratively refines algorithms, drawing on the creative power of LLMs,

Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.98,0:03:11.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, their first paper was FunSearch, which was very, very similar.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.24,0:03:14.62,Default,,0,0,0,,The main difference, I think, was that it was just
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.22,0:03:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,searching for a single function rather than Alpha Evolve,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.44,0:03:21.14,Default,,0,0,0,,which can essentially work over an entire codebase.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:21.14,0:03:25.52,Default,,0,0,0,,You just demarcate adaptable regions in a codebase,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.54,0:03:27.02,Default,,0,0,0,,and it can search for those.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:27.04,0:03:29.48,Default,,0,0,0,,Of course, it's even optimizing for interactions
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.52,0:03:32.82,Default,,0,0,0,,between those functions in different parts of your codebase.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.98,0:03:35.62,Default,,0,0,0,,One potential issue, as Keith Duggar pointed out,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.64,0:03:38.68,Default,,0,0,0,,is the classic halting problem in computer science.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.72,0:03:41.54,Default,,0,0,0,,But there's also a really subtle limitation here
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.58,0:03:43.48,Default,,0,0,0,,I want to explore with you guys a bit,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.52,0:03:46.72,Default,,0,0,0,,which is running the programs themselves.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.94,0:03:48.62,Default,,0,0,0,,We face issues, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:48.66,0:03:51.26,Default,,0,0,0,,You face issues of the halting problem, for one thing.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.30,0:03:53.10,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, you start running some code,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:53.12,0:03:56.62,Default,,0,0,0,,like the code compiles fine or doesn't crash immediately,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:56.66,0:04:01.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and it starts running, but maybe some time goes by, like an hour.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.62,0:04:04.86,Default,,0,0,0,,And you're like, well, geez, is this thing ever going to terminate?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:04.90,0:04:06.62,Default,,0,0,0,,In theory, you're of course right.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.66,0:04:10.40,Default,,0,0,0,,You can never tell that if you run an algorithm for longer what it would have done.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.42,0:04:13.96,Default,,0,0,0,,But in practice, it actually hasn't been any sort of issue for us
Dialogue: 0,0:04:14.00,0:04:15.96,Default,,0,0,0,,in the applications that we looked at.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:15.96,0:04:19.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Alexander Novikov added that this challenge is very much like

Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.36,0:04:25.74,Default,,0,0,0,,How do you know that you should stop working on your problem as a human?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.76,0:04:29.34,Default,,0,0,0,,Or maybe you spend a month more and then you solve it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.36,0:04:30.00,Default,,0,0,0,,It's hard.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.04,0:04:32.44,Default,,0,0,0,,I mean, of course, there's still limitations.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.46,0:04:36.74,Default,,0,0,0,,They didn't bite much on my halting problem limitation.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.76,0:04:40.06,Default,,0,0,0,,So in practice, it was okay for them,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.10,0:04:44.00,Default,,0,0,0,,but they had these very well-chosen problems, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.04,0:04:46.24,Default,,0,0,0,,We're like, okay, matrix multiplication.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.28,0:04:49.64,Default,,0,0,0,,You know, if it's any slower than Strassen's algorithm,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.68,0:04:51.38,Default,,0,0,0,,maybe you can turn it off.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.40,0:04:55.94,Default,,0,0,0,,But the problem is that that restricts your open-ended search capabilities, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:55.98,0:05:00.40,Default,,0,0,0,,You can't go down the path of a potentially slower algorithm for now
Dialogue: 0,0:05:00.44,0:05:05.58,Default,,0,0,0,,that may get you to a stepping stone that hops you over to something more efficient.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.60,0:05:06.64,Default,,0,0,0,,It is interesting, isn't it?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.68,0:05:09.98,Default,,0,0,0,,There's so many breakthroughs in science are unknown unknowns.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.00,0:05:12.08,Default,,0,0,0,,We might have a nose for what is interesting,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:12.12,0:05:15.36,Default,,0,0,0,,but we never really know where to find the answers.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.38,0:05:18.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And so often it's the case that we find them through sheer luck.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:18.78,0:05:23.16,Default,,0,0,0,,But there must be at least one step we can take in the direction of mechanizing
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.18,0:05:25.62,Default,,0,0,0,,and accelerating this process.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.66,0:05:29.66,Default,,0,0,0,,In the case of matrix multiplication and several other scientific problems
Dialogue: 0,0:05:29.68,0:05:32.22,Default,,0,0,0,,which had a clear evaluation function,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.26,0:05:35.56,Default,,0,0,0,,this new evolutionary approach achieved much
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.58,0:05:38.48,Default,,0,0,0,,which decades of human research could not.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.52,0:05:41.16,Default,,0,0,0,,We just ran it for completeness because we wanted to have this,

Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.86,0:05:58.50,Default,,0,0,0,,that, oh, it seems like we have this result, I just couldn't believe it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:58.54,0:05:59.90,Default,,0,0,0,,Like, let's triple check it.

Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.38,0:08:54.42,Default,,0,0,0,,where there is a strong collaborative loop between humans and AIs.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:54.46,0:08:58.32,Default,,0,0,0,,And we should just bring in how you modeled this representation.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:58.36,0:08:59.76,Default,,0,0,0,,So you had these different approaches,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.78,0:09:02.16,Default,,0,0,0,,you could directly model the solution,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.18,0:09:03.88,Default,,0,0,0,,you could model a constructor function,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:03.88,0:09:07.96,Default,,0,0,0,,so you're actually learning a function which itself constructs the solution,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.98,0:09:09.66,Default,,0,0,0,,you could be learning a search algorithm
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.68,0:09:11.46,Default,,0,0,0,,which is what you did with the matrix multiplication,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.48,0:09:15.56,Default,,0,0,0,,and you also spoke about coevolution as a possibility.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.58,0:09:18.32,Default,,0,0,0,,So many people are talking about this vision of AIs
Dialogue: 0,0:09:18.36,0:09:23.26,Default,,0,0,0,,which can autonomously just drive cars or just do anything,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.28,0:09:26.66,Default,,0,0,0,,generate content without any supervision from humans.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:26.68,0:09:29.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And that hasn't really panned out to be honest.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:29.18,0:09:32.76,Default,,0,0,0,,And certainly a lot of the content on the internet is slop.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.76,0:09:36.94,Default,,0,0,0,,Do you remember that dead internet theory by IlluminatiPirate,
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.96,0:09:39.74,Default,,0,0,0,,this guy on an internet forum a couple of years ago?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.76,0:09:44.24,Default,,0,0,0,,He said that by now most content on the internet will be generated by AI
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.26,0:09:47.04,Default,,0,0,0,,and it will have a kind of superficiality to it.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.06,0:09:48.90,Default,,0,0,0,,And he was right.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:48.94,0:09:50.94,Default,,0,0,0,,But it doesn't necessarily mean that AI is bad, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.96,0:09:54.44,Default,,0,0,0,,What's missing is that we need to have this exchange.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.46,0:09:58.10,Default,,0,0,0,,We need to use AIs as tools and we need to guide them
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.14,0:10:02.60,Default,,0,0,0,,and refine the results and do the process iteratively.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:02.68,0:10:04.68,Default,,0,0,0,,That's kind of what AlphaRevolve does.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:04.70,0:10:09.18,Default,,0,0,0,,It mechanizes the correct way of using AI.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.20,0:10:12.98,Default,,0,0,0,,The thing that makes AlphaRevolve so cool and powerful
Dialogue: 0,0:10:13.00,0:10:15.88,Default,,0,0,0,,is this kind of this mech-and-forbidden humans and machines, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:15.90,0:10:18.08,Default,,0,0,0,,And like the humans ask questions,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:18.10,0:10:20.58,Default,,0,0,0,,the system gives you some form of the answer
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.60,0:10:22.28,Default,,0,0,0,,and then you improve your intuition,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:22.30,0:10:25.78,Default,,0,0,0,,you improve your question-asking ability, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:25.80,0:10:27.28,Default,,0,0,0,,And you ask more questions.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:27.30,0:10:30.88,Default,,0,0,0,,I gave this talk a few times about generation AI
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.88,0:10:34.96,Default,,0,0,0,,and the big warning I gave is just the rise of mediocrity.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:34.98,0:10:39.56,Default,,0,0,0,,We're just going to be inundated and flooded with mediocrity
Dialogue: 0,0:10:39.58,0:10:44.26,Default,,0,0,0,,and the best content will still be produced by the most skilled people.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:44.28,0:10:48.16,Default,,0,0,0,,And all that's going to happen is as this tide of mediocrity
Dialogue: 0,0:10:48.18,0:10:49.46,Default,,0,0,0,,grows larger and larger,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.48,0:10:54.66,Default,,0,0,0,,people will get hungrier and hungrier for the cream,
Dialogue: 0,0:10:54.68,0:10:57.06,Default,,0,0,0,,for the things that are rising to the top, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.16,0:11:00.74,Default,,0,0,0,,So I think all that's going to happen in the end
Dialogue: 0,0:11:00.76,0:11:05.04,Default,,0,0,0,,is that skilled people, their productivity is going to just rise
Dialogue: 0,0:11:05.06,0:11:07.54,Default,,0,0,0,,and they'll continue to be differentiated
Dialogue: 0,0:11:07.56,0:11:12.94,Default,,0,0,0,,from the mediocre sort of hordes whose productivity is also enabled.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:12.96,0:11:18.24,Default,,0,0,0,,So the hordes become more productive and experts become more productive
Dialogue: 0,0:11:18.26,0:11:21.24,Default,,0,0,0,,and just as a whole, we all become more productive.
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.26,0:11:24.84,Default,,0,0,0,,And while we're on the subject of amazing innovative architectures
Dialogue: 0,0:11:24.94,0:11:28.72,Default,,0,0,0,,for discrete program synthesis and reasoning and whatnot,
Dialogue: 0,0:11:28.74,0:11:32.32,Default,,0,0,0,,why don't you consider applying to work at Two for AI Labs?
Dialogue: 0,0:11:32.34,0:11:37.12,Default,,0,0,0,,That's if you're an ML research scientist or ML engineer.
